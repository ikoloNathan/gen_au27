Base Active Object class.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$active\+\_\+object.\+h$>$}



\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Base Active Object class. 

The Active Object pattern enables event-\/driven execution with stateful behavior. This structure encapsulates an object that can process messages asynchronously.

Each Active Object\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Is linked to a {\bfseries{message broker}} for event dispatching.
\item Runs within a {\bfseries{separate task/thread}} (depending on platform).
\item Uses a {\bfseries{Finite State Machine (FSM)}} to manage state transitions.
\item Can define a {\bfseries{custom initialization state}} ({\ttfamily initialisation\+\_\+state}). 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
include/active\+\_\+object.\+h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
